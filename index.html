                        <p>During my high school years, I have always known that I had a passion for technology and design. As such, my goal has been to become a web designer, front developer, UI/UX designer, and web and software developer. This desire has motivated me to take various courses, attend workshops, and engage in self-learning to equip myself with the necessary skills and knowledge.

                            One of my major accomplishments during my high school life was developing a website for a local charity organization. The site was designed to promote the organization's mission, generate donations, and enhance their online presence. The project involved creating wireframes, designing the user interface, developing functionality, and optimizing the site for search engine optimization (SEO). Through this project, I was able to hone my skills in web development and gain hands-on experience in designing websites.
